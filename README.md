# Code and Design Decisions

<!-- Please document your code & design decisions here. -->
I chose to use react material ui based on my experience with it and the timeline.
I chose css grid to align the property cards. I limited the fetch to only pull 9 properties. 
I also needed a bas64 encoding library to fetch the properties. The properties are loaded every time the page is loaded refreshed instead of saved. I added notes to the code and as many tests as I could before I ran out of time.
